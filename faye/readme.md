# Loomio faye server

This repo contains a Dockerfile, Gemfile and rackup file to run a
[Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com/) server for your Loomio installation.

The general idea is that you start a VPS, clone this repo onto it, build and run
the docker image.

This is explained in some detail in the [Loomio tech manual](https://loomio.gitbooks.io/tech-manual/content/setup_faye.html)
